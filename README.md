## Usage

The project contains implementations of three functions:

    is_balanced(expression): Determines whether a given expression with parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets is balanced.

    remove_duplicates(sequence): Removes duplicates from a given sequence (list or tuple) while maintaining the original order.
